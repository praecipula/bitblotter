# Who are the customers of DevRel?

I find the fact that DevRel exists in a cross-functional and cross-organizational space energizing. There is something freeing in being in the liminal space between teams where there are very few rote answers or off-the-shelf solutions to many problems. One of the joys of DevRel is finding new and better ways to engage with our audience.

But who is our audience?

## DevRel owns developer experience

In [Who is Developer Relations] I touched on how I believe that Developer Relations owns the developer experience. By this I don't mean an adoption or usage experience, that is, the zero-to-one experience of a developer walking through the process of adoption or usage of an API. That is a perfectly valid and important concern, and may be owned by DevRel or some other team within the organization.

I mean rather the human experience of interfacing with your product and your team: who are your developers? And what are their experiences like?

So the following is a breakdown of some of the various audiences and stakeholders that DevRel interacts with.

## Also interface on the outside:
### External developers themselves
### Support / user operations teams
### Client account teams
### UXR
### Sales teams
### Marketing

## Internal teams
### Engineering (api)
### Engineering (non-api / product)
### Product management / planners

## Also, not part of job function of ICs
### Management chain
### Recruiting
### 

DevRel is a filter and an emulsifier between teams
