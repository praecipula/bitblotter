Check ➡️[this Asana project out](https://app.asana.com/read-only/Matt's-Road-Trip/112522539809863/ffb8be00864244d8ce778e53320ae2f9/list)⬅️ for a more up-to-date and alive agenda of Matt's plans for the next few days

(I can easily update the tasks in Asana while on the move / from my phone; updating the blog is a little more involved.)
