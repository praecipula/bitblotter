I woke up to the most chill campsite in the universe. For some reason I didn't take a photo in daytime of the campsite, but it had a lovely view of I-5 and the cars going by, which for me is sort of like watching a screensaver - super relaxing. I had acquired some Starbucks mocha bottled coffee and had the chance to sit in the back of the car and sip it while watching the sun rise.

What I *did* take a photo of for some reason was another Tesla Model Y clearly doing the exact same thing, so clearly I'm not alone! I never got a chance to compare notes with whoever was doing that, although it would have been fun to do so!

After a late start in the morning I went and charged up the car at a Supercharger and headed down the beach to Malibu and Santa Monica. The drive was super chill and laid back, it's interesting to me how very California it felt but how the quality of the scene seemed different, very So Cal - car culture and streamline moderne and palm trees. I liked the coast here, the drive somehow made Malibu feel smaller, in that "I was expecting it to be bigger" way that you feel when navigating a familiar and noteworthy experience in person for the first time. I had a strong impression that Malibu felt very like Hawaii, with really tall verdant hills leading right down to the beach. As far as I can tell, though, it reminded me of neither coconuts nor rum.

I then made my way down to Santa Monica pier. I've been here before and I recall, and still am, curious about how and why piers became entertainment venues. Who decided that "a place for boats to park" meant good clean family fun? Anyway, I wanted to get to the pier for one specific reason: there was never an "official" start or end to Route 66, rather it seems to have wandered about over time, but since you *can* draw a straight line down from where Route 66 is to Santa Monica, why not? You might attract nutters like me to come take a selfie in front of the sign.

And just like that it was time to head to the Airbnb. The sun was setting by this time and was gorgeous...

but that also means it was time to grab some food. I headed over to the neighborhood where I'm staying and searched around for something that sounded good, and the great and powerful Google recommended a "deli and bottle shop" that sounded curious, so off I went. The menu was, hmm, eclectic, just as expected from the marketing - "Wine, Cold Cuts, Pasta, Sandwiches, Craft Beers, Catering, Pizza, Cheeses". I opted to pass on all but a sandwich (a pastrami/roast beef/pickle sandwich) and some truffle fries, because I dunno, they sounded good. And, in fact, they were! I was a little leery because I find that small sandwich shops can sometimes get, well, a little enthusiastic with the amount of meat that goes in the sandwich, but it was just right, with really nice dutch crunch style bread. Well, suggested, Google!

And on to the Airbnb, where I got into a bath to wash off the road grunge and hopped straight into pajamas. After that I popped a movie on and chilled out for the rest of the evening. It's nice and quiet here, quite comfortable, and I feel I'm going to enjoy being in this space.
