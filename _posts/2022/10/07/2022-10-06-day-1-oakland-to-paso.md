I managed to get away from Oakland at about 2:00 PM. That was a bit later than I had originally envisioned, because I wanted to beat the bulk of rush hour along the Bay Area. Regardless, it was fairly light through the immediate vicinity, so that was fine.

I stopped for my first supercharging session in south San Jose at a Bass Pro Shops. You never know where the superchargers are located, so it's kind of a crap shoot for what kind of stores you'll find. It's been ages since I've been to a Bass Pro Shops, so it was an interesting chance to go in and observe the outdoors through the eyes of "outdoorsmen" types. I don't hunt, RV camp other than cheater Tesla camping, or, really, wear camo so there wasn't a lot that was really calling to me. The cooking section was kinda interesting though - lotta propane and gas stoves, lotta cast iron. I picked up some more white gas for the small camping stove I brought.

After the next supercharger stop about an hour north of Paso I noticed that the windshield wipers would go as if they thought it was sprinkling. When I got to my next stop, I noticed a **big spidery crack in the windshield** ðŸ˜­ - I'm not sure what happened, but it's right over the front self driving cameras. They still seemed to operate OK, at least at night so I put the wipers on manual and we'll see what's up tomorrow. I'm a little concerned that if the sunlight hits the crack it will cause the car to be confused, so I'll test it out tomorrow. It would dampen the whole trip if I can't use autopilot to tool around, but, still, people get by in other cars without Elon taking the wheel. I think it will be fine for the trip (it doesn't obstruct the view for me) but it will require replacement when I get back.

I'm staying at the parking lot with [the supercharger in Paso Robles near the TJ Maxx.](https://goo.gl/maps/zM3m2gaNmPpB2Bid8) I'm hoping that I can escape notice by blending in with the other Teslas that will go in and out, and there will be activity / it's well lit. My main concern is that I'll get spotted by a security patrol and be asked to leave. I'll give updates tomorrow.

OK, midnight, lights out.
