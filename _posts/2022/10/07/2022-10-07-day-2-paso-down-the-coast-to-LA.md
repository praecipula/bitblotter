I made it through the night!

I didn't get *great* sleep, but I didn't expect to. Roughly 6 hours of medium quality. I didn't want to take melatonin or anything in case of any friendly "get the heck out" knocks from a security patrol asking me to leave - it's not a good idea to drive around half asleep.

Thankfully that didn't happen.

This morning I updated the blog with a bit more information about what my plans are and how to more easily see what's going on in a "this is easier for me to broadcast" way via a [read-only Asana project](https://app.asana.com/read-only/Matt's-Road-Trip/112522539809863/ffb8be00864244d8ce778e53320ae2f9/list). I wish the read-only view would allow displaying of pictures, but oh well. At least it's possible to see top-level plans this way and/or a proof of life.

That being said, I have time as I'm planning out my day this morning, so I might as well draft a post. As I figure out more kinks in the system I'll probably just stick to the Asana project until I actually blog the day.

Tonight I'll be staying at a campground just north of LA, [Oak Flat Campground](https://goo.gl/maps/8TwoorqFKpTiRmMy7). This is one of those campgrounds that you can stay at with an America the Beautiful national park annual pass; thankfully I thought ahead to get one before the trip. Before I get there I'll be stopping at this [Tesla supercharger](https://goo.gl/maps/D58TgQ5eeWwUXknu5) to get a top-up for the car.

During the day I'm planning on checking out Paso Robles and driving down the coast through Santa Barbara. I haven't spent much time down on this part of the coast, so I'll see where the day takes me. I think I'd like to get in to Santa Barbara in early afternoon, so that's roughly my pacing.

Tesla stats over the night:

~ 8 hours of temperature control (66 degrees) to a night that was about 70-65 degrees overnight
Battery usage: 100-85% (15% usage for temp control), or about 2% per hour.
