After a nice leisurely morning of coffee, cereal, and milk, I showered up and got ready to head out. I decided that my first stop of the day would be lunch; not just any lunch, but lunch at the oldest operating McDonald's in Downey, CA

Well, OK, I guess you can say that a McDonald's cheeseburger is as close to "just any lunch" as it's possible to get.

It was an interesting location to check out: today it is pretty much a bona-fide McDonald's, with all of the standard fare, but you walk up to the counter like an old timey burger drive-in, because that's exactly what it is. In fact, until 1990 it *was* a McDonald's, but not of the franchise of McDonald's, but rather of the *original* franchise owned by the McDonald's brothers before Ray Kroc took over and created the McDonald's we know today. So it was a genuine McDonald's named after the same brothers who founded the chain, but wasn't the same restaurant as the global McDonald's we know today. You can read more about it in this plaque because of course there was an informational plaque and of course I took a picture of it.

There was also a little museum that had some memorabilia, but it was a little ho-hum if you ask me. I get the impression that the good folks at McDonald's didn't really keep a lot of old assets and rather just swept up some old dusty stuff from a warehouse or something to put the museum together. Worth seeing once, I would say, but I wouldn't super go out of the way to get back here.

And, as far as photo or noteworthy stories go, that was pretty much it. Another thing about LA is that it takes so long to get from place to place; it took up half of the day to go the few miles to Downey, eat lunch, and come back. In the evening I took a walk to get some asian / fried rice from a place that Google recommended; I got the chicken and broccoli with veggie fried rice and it was in fact pretty good! Thank goodness for getting some broccoli in the diet, some vegetable matter really hit the spot.

And tonight I'll try to get some rest. I'm planning on hitting more of the sights of LA and Route 66 so I'll likely have more photos to share, depending on how many spots I'll be able to get to in the day!
