Today I decided to do the intermediate part of route 66 - [I visited Santa Monica pier](bitblotter/update/2022/10/08/day-3-first-day-in-LA.html) on my way in to LA, but there was this whole stretch westward from my Airbnb to Santa Monica from where I was staying past Dodger Stadium, along Santa Monica Boulevard through Hollywood and Beverly Hills and down to Santa Monica Pier.

I also took the time today to visit some of Downtown LA - I have never really explored the downtown area since LA is so sprawling and I've never had a reason to be downtown, so while it's not technically really on Route 66 it's only like 5 miles off of the route, might as well.

I really think I started to grasp LA with a little covering of its history, [thanks to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles#History). Los Angeles was one of the first major missions after San Diego that Junipero Serra established in California (I'm assuming because of the proximity to the LA River). Some stuff happened to grow the city slowly but steadily; it became the capital of its Mexican provence, after California became part of the US the Southern Pacific railroad terminated there (and, in fact, this is why Route 66 goes to LA - a decree that the westward path of rail and migration follow any existing paths as close to the 35th parallel as possible).

And then they found the oil; Los Angeles is just *floating* with oil. That's why the La Brea tar pits are there. By around the time of World War 1 California was producing about a quarter of the global petroleum supply, and the city had grown quite large.

Around this time movie production moved to Los Angeles from San Francisco in the 1910s because the varied scenery and consistent weather made it great for making movies. So LA continued to grow, and so did small cities that lay outside of LA (Hollywood, Santa Monica, etc...) One other key element seems to be the water rights; in 1913, William Mulholland secured rights for the Los Angeles aqueduct to supply water to the city - and only the city of LA. This caused all the surrounding cities to glom together with LA to make one big municipal area that is, in fact, _all_ Los Angeles, because that's how you get the water.

And that's pretty much it: Los Angeles, the place where you simply have to get in a car and go to another place to get anything, because everyplace wanted to be part of LA, driving lots of outward, not upward, growth.

Anyway, my travels saw me starting out around midday from home and working my way into downtown. I decided to go toward City Hall (the classic mostly-tower-shaped building on Los Angeles police badges) and wander my way toward US Bank Tower (the giant building that got annihilated in Independence Day). This turned out to be a very interesting way to wander; I didn't realize that downtown LA is so hilly. the US Bank tower is giant, yes, but it's also on top of a hill, a hill that just has long tunnels bored right through it. It reminded me of the Broadway tunnel in San Francisco, but, if anything, longer, and 3 or 4 tunnels in a row, cut right the heck under the financial district skyscrapers of LA.

I parked in the World Trade Center parking lot because it was about in the right place and I figured one location was as good as any. I set off by going through one of these tunnels which had a nice wide sidewalk just for the heck of it.

The walk around LA was interesting in a "this could be the background Gotham set for any nameless city" sort of way. Just as I would find my self ho-humming the walk, I'd turn a corner and see something totally iconic; City Hall, or the Walt Disney concert hall, and immediately feel that sense of "no, wait, this is *definitely* Los Angeles"

Having explored the older and more skyscraper-y part of the city I decided to get a move on, and went back to get the car.

2 hours passed.

It turns out that trying to approach the entrance to the World Trade Center parking lot you *must* approach it from the west. If you try to get to it from the east (that is, from downtown LA) you end up on top of the hill and subsequently on the roof of the garage, in a nice plaza between all the financial skyscrapers, with no apparent way to access the garage - no elevators, stairs, nothing. I had to detour to the north all the way off the hill then flank the garage from the west, that or go back toward downtown and find a tunnel to go back through.

I chose the flanking maneuver.

After that, and entering the garage through one of the many portals (facing west only) labeled "Not a pedestrian path" as there seemed to be no human doors (seriously, how are people on foot even supposed to get in and out of this thing?!) I found myself in the most poorly organized parking garage ever. It's the only time I've had to use the "where is my car" map on the Tesla app on my phone **while in the same parking garage as the car**. There were parking labels, but they were just bonkers; like, sections A, C, E on the north side, B, D, F on the south, and the floor numbers change not on the ramp parts but randomly in the middle of a completely horizontal floor. I felt like someone had fed me crazy pills in my cereal or something.

Anyway, after finding the car I just got out of the garage. Oh, right - the parking was 28 dollars, charged at 3.50 every 15 minutes. So just the time it took to find the car would have maxed out the daily rate, let alone the time I spent walking. After exiting, I never saw a daily cap higher than 20 bucks anywhere else.

Civic Center Parking Garage: ⭐️☆☆☆☆

Finally, having liberated the car and my wallet, I started driving vaguely northish to pick up Sunset Boulevard, where I would start my journey west through Hollywood. I missed the exit (something else I learned: LA had the earliest limited-access roads in the country, and they clearly didn't quite get the hang of how to do it yet) and wound up near the stadium. No biggie, so long as there isn't an event at the stadium it'd be cool to check it out!

The Dodgers were at home in about 3 hours. Well, thankfully I got a lucky break here: there was enough game-day-looking traffic to cause some detours, but not enough to really funnel you directly to the stadium from all corners, not just yet. I was able to squirm my way through a short 1-block stretch of "local traffic only" (why only one block? Who's to know?) and I escaped, but not in a way that allowed me to visit the stadium. Ah, well, no big deal.

Now that it was considerably past lunch I decided to get a snack. Looking on Google, there was something I'd seldom seen before: a small little shop with plenty of reviews (42) and 5.0 stars--not 4-point-round-up, 5.0. So I might as well take a look, right?

Ceci's Gastronomia is, to put it plainly, a focaccia bread place, where the olive-oil-drenched breads are topped with various tasty ingredients. Think of it as something like a proto-pizza. The Pissallandrea was calling to me because it sounded like, a classic tasty salty goodness bomb: tomato sauce (but thick, like almost a paste, and baked on the bread to concentrate), anchovies, taggiasca olives.

It was, I believe, the best focaccia I've ever had, let alone focaccia with toppings. Every part of it was top notch - the focaccia was so well done, the olive oil tasted like the real, peppery, soft and round good stuff, the anchovies were somewhat salty--not too much--but super umami, and the olives were a top notch choice that baked so well and tied everything together. I'm just about drooling thinking about it now, it was **so good.**

Ceci's Gastronomia: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Day recovered, I continued on my way.

Wandering west on Sunset, I next headed to Hollywood Cemetery and Paramount Picures Studio (they split a city block in central Hollywood). This was an unexpected surprise - Paramount actually looked really cool, and I should have planned to do the studio tour. Back when Hollywood, the city, was growing, Paramount decided to just up and buy a whole contiguous block of land to turn into their studio. And that's it - within a walkable perimiter is a large proportion of where everything Paramount is filmed (everything not on location / everything on a soundstage). For one example, there was a lot of signage about the Dr. Phil show, and you can just look from the street and see the studio where it's shot. And that big building over there is where a whole bunch of stuff was filmed, right between Leonard Nimoy Way and Michael Bay Avenue. There is even the iconic old-timey movie-studio-water-tower feature hovering over the lot. Paramount is the only production company that's still inside of LA proper, and I think that gives it an enhanced "I'm looking in at Who Framed Roger Rabbit toontown"-like feel.

Right behind it is the Hollywood Forever cemetery. This was interesting in its own right, because it has some A-list celebrities buried there (Judy Garland, Mel Brooks) but it wasn't nearly as packed as I thought it would be - seems like it'd be a popular place to be. Additionally, there are no sidewalks or paths, so to look around you just have to walk over some dead guy or nearly get run over in the street. I chose the street, mostly.

During the summer they show al fresco movies in the cemetery; think about it--movies outside in a drive-in-like setting right next to Paramount Pictures! I spent so much time looking up Route 66 stuff that I just missed the opportunity here. Ah, well, next time; I don't think Paramount or Judy Garland will be going anywhere anytime soon.

Continuing on, and purposefully avoiding the Sunset Strip / really touristy part of Hollywood (Laurie and I have been there, seen that) I picked up the Sunset Strip at Whisky a Go Go, which is mostly known for 2 things:

1. Not having a great drinks selection of whisky or otherwise - it's a nightclub, and
2. Creating the suffix phrase -"a go go" and introducing the world to Go Go dancers

I passed it by. I also missed going to The Comedy Store - I really wanted to, but their lineup was downright bland and/or was just open mike night while I was in LA. You never know, big names sometimes show up for open mikes at The Comedy Store, but what are the chances?

So onward to Beverly Hills. I stopped off at Greystone Mansion, which is administered by the municipality of Beverly Hills. To my cynical mind it's a lightning rod to get people to go see a thing in Beverly Hills so they don't go knocking on The Rock's house or whatever. Greystone Mansion is also apparently the site of a lot of filming for movies; scanning the list, I recognized spots from Tommy Boy (near the beginning the wedding scene where the dad has a heart attack happens at an outdoor event space at the foot of a flight of stairs) and X-Men (the mansion proper is the school for mutants). Pretty cool, but also, as so often happens with the movies, not as big as expected: instead of larger-than-life, it was small because it *is* life. Still a neat place to view the city from the hills, though, and lovely, and quiet - I can see why folks want to live in the Atherton of LA.

And back home! I drove back along Wilshire Blvd. Mom, I took a picture just for you:

![No sinkhole](/bitblotter/assets/img/2022/10/PXL_20221011_235912742.jpg)

The building on the left is the Academy's Museum of Motion Pictures and on the right the red building is the Peterson Automotive Museum. Not pictured: a giant sinkhole to the past. I don't know why I didn't pick this up, but I assumed that these were just notable buildngs that artistic license put near the sinkhole in La Brea; but no, in fact, they are directly adjacent to the La Brea tar pits, which are about where the trees and crane are in this picture. I guess sometimes a really noteworthy piece of architecture does fall directly into the plot all easy-peasy.

And that was it! The drive back on Wilshire Boulevard was like driving up El Camino Real in the bay area peninsula, or Man O' War Blvd near downtown Lexington: It's a road. With some buildings, and maybe a mall if you're in the right place. It's fascinating to me that names that we hear through popular culture are in fact not that special, they are just near where the media gets created, so they get incorporated.

And on that note, I'll be headed to Pasadena tomorrow, with an eye to find any little old ladies and driving down Colorado Blvd.
