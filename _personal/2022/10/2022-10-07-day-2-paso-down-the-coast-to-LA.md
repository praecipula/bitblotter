I made it through the night without interruptions!

I didn't get *great* sleep, but I didn't expect to. Roughly 6 hours of medium quality. I didn't want to take melatonin or anything in case of any friendly "get the heck out" knocks from a security patrol asking me to leave - it's not a good idea to drive around half asleep.

Thankfully that didn't happen.

This morning I updated the blog with a bit more information about what my plans are and how to more easily see what's going on in a "this is easier for me to broadcast" way via a [read-only Asana project](https://app.asana.com/read-only/Matt's-Road-Trip/112522539809863/ffb8be00864244d8ce778e53320ae2f9/list). I wish the read-only view would allow displaying of pictures, but oh well. At least it's possible to see top-level plans this way and/or a proof of life.

That being said, I have time as I'm planning out my day this morning, so I might as well draft a post. As I figure out more kinks in the system I'll probably just stick to the Asana project until I actually blog the day. It doesn't come as that big of a surprise to me, but this is already very much a workable system and the blog is soon going to catch up such that the Asana project is mostly dynamic / progress reports on the day.

Tonight I'll be staying at a campground just north of LA, [Oak Flat Campground](https://goo.gl/maps/8TwoorqFKpTiRmMy7). This is one of those campgrounds that you can stay at with an America the Beautiful national park annual pass; thankfully I thought ahead to get one before the trip. Before I get there I'll be stopping at this [Tesla supercharger](https://goo.gl/maps/D58TgQ5eeWwUXknu5) to get a top-up for the car.

During the day I'm planning on checking out Paso Robles and driving down the coast through Santa Barbara. I haven't spent much time down on this part of the coast, so I'll see where the day takes me. I think I'd like to get in to Santa Barbara in early afternoon, so that's roughly my pacing.

Tesla stats over the night:

~ 8 hours of temperature control (66 degrees) to a night that was about 70-65 degrees overnight
Battery usage: 100-85% (15% usage for temp control), or about 2% per hour.

======

OK, I'm at the campground!

It was a great day; the temperature swung wildly between 65 and 75 degrees (oh my!) and there was a nice variety of weather to drive through. The fall in California doesn't have the same fall leaf effect that happens on the east coast, but it does have the benefit of cycling through foggy, to clear, to foggy over the course of the day, with the mountains affecting how much the marine layer influences the weather. That means that in the fall at least, the time of day determines what you might see.

After grabbing a coffee and a blueberry scone from Starbucks (mostly because Laurie and I were recently talking about how we are lukewarm about blueberries, so I thought I'd mix things up. Verdict? Yep, still a pretty OK way to get fruit, I guess) I got the car topped off and headed toward the shore, starting my coastal journey at Morro Bay.

A "morro" is apparently the name of a certain kind of geological formation where a volcano forms and the outside erodes away, leaving the strong igneous rock in the middle. This is the way quite a few big-stuff geological formations happen in California, and there are a string of them at the coast here. Now I'm curious what the difference is between these rocks and something like Devil's Tower, or Ayer's Rock / whatsit called now (Uluru, is that right?) - maybe those are also morros? Anyway, there's a well known one in the bay and I decided to cut over to check that out.

See it there?

Ok, it was totally erased by the fog... it's supposed to look something like the picture on the plaque. I'd been here before with friends, at about this time of year, and yep, it looked exactly like this. I'm not that surprised, and not actually that disappointed - it's, well, a big rock.

I got into a friendly chat with a guy who was interested in getting a Tesla, so I did my standard "I own a Tesla and here is my sales pitch" song and dance. They say that when you get a Tesla you'll end up answering a lot of questions, and it was true here. Still, he was very friendly and we had a fun chat!

I moved on down the coast, stopping next at San Luis Obispo. SLO (the initials are fairly commonly used) is the site of Cal Poly and not much else, really. It was apparently really good hunting and fishing ground back in the day, and when Spain was having trouble supplying the Missions along El Camino Real back in the Spanish Alta California days, Junipero Serra went back down from around Monterey to establish San Luis Obispo for the purpose of providing food for the other missions. To that end the mission in SLO was established right on a pleasant little creek that is at the end of an estuary, so I guess it was mainly just good hunting and fishing grounds.

Other than that, and the university, it didn't seem like there's much of a "why" to SLO, in the way that the "why" of San Francisco is its fantastic port during gold rush days. And yet, I find I really *really* liked the downtown! It felt built up like a modern-day take on an out-west town, where the salloons have turned to upscale cocktail bars and the pork n' beaneries turned into lovely restaurants. The buildings were mostly old or had preserved old facade, but they were nice for that time - I think SLO benefited by being a chronologocally late Mission town, so it was only a bit adobe but more brick and old iron of the late 1800's type of California construction. I think Laurie would love it here (take note, Laurie! We have to come visit sometime). We laugh about how we tend to like hipster-y parts of towns (we just like things that are done a way that hipsters also happen to like, ok?!) and SLO totally fits that, down to the gum wall a la Seattle. I had a very pleasant lunch of a wood-fired foccacia chicken pesto sun-dried tomato sandwich and it was quite good.

From there I wandered down the coast on 101 to Santa Barbara. I didn't get much time there, unfortunately, nor on the way at Pismo Beach that seemed like it would be fun. My fleeting impressions are that Pismo Beach feels kind of like Daytona Beach and Santa Barbara feels like... Santa Cruz without the boardwalk, or Monterey with more of a central / downtown / less pure-old-industry-city feel.

Finally, I made it to the campsite. This is a wonderful space and I'd absolutely stay here again if heading down to LA - it's right before the edge of LA off of Highway 5, so feels like the last of the road after getting through Donner Pass before plunging into LA. When going to LA, my experience is that it feels like half of the trip is getting to the border of LA and the other half is getting through LA to wherever you're going, so this could be a great overnight stopover for that kind of trip.

The moon is waxing gibbous and almost full, so there's lots of light to see the space. Additionally, with all the shades up in the car it's nice and dark, and I think it will be a wonderful place to stay for the evening; enough ambient light to enjoy the evening but dark in the "tent".

I'm just updating this blog and figuring out how to do things like insert pictures into it, then maybe reading a bit and going to bed. I'm pretty pleased with how the blog is turning out so far and it's fun to get it up and running in time to share how the trip is going!

Tomorrow will be some sort of LA adventure and checking into the Airbnb, which is at [2021 1/2 Vineburn Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90032](https://goo.gl/maps/3zJC3uwjMNiY93J48). I'll be able to check in after 4, I'm not sure when in the evening I'll actually make it there but I'm frankly looking forward to a shower.

As for what I do in the morning, I'll figure that out in the morning! I'm good with a slow day here at the campsite to sip coffee and plan out what the day will hold.
