Not much to report for this day, actually. I decided to take it as a relaxing day of exploring the neighborhood and enjoying the Airbnb. I did make it out for a bit to charge up the car, taking the time to walk around and enjoy the neighborhoods. I had forgotten how spacious LA feels - it's sprawling, sure, but there's just a lot of space between everything - big city blocks, big lots for buildings and homes, big stretches of industrial areas. LA also just has a feel to it; palm trees and hazy weather, and more humidity than up in the bay area.

I continued my movie splurge under the excuse that I'm studying up for Disneyland, or, something.

Anyway, it was nice to have an "off" day of relaxation and lounging about, I plan to be a little more active tomorrow and see some of the sights I've been planning to hit!
