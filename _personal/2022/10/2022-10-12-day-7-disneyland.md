And today: Disneyland!


I made sure to get up in plenty of time to drive down to Anaheim so that I could get parked and get into Disneyland near when it opened but not in the just-pre-opening first crush of people getting there for the exact minute it opens. I managed to get there just at the right time, about half an hour after it opened and, was parked and taking the tram into the Disneyland complex by an hour after it opened, about nine o'clock. When I bought the ticket, I decided that I wanted to do the park hopper, because I would only be at Disney for one day, which seemed like it'd be fine assuming that the crowds wouldn't be too heavy in the middle of the week during school season, and so at 9AM I wandered into California Adventure.

I decided to optimize for rides that have changed or have been added since I had been there last and ones that have a Halloween theme to them. I started with the new iteration of the Tower of Terror, which is now "Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT". I was only in line for about 45 minutes; this would turn out to be about average for ride times during the day, so it wasn't too crowded.

I think they did some adjustments or retrofitting when they changed it over to the Avengers theme; the basic mechanics of the ride were the same, bouncing up and down an elevator shaft, but all of the lead-up line area was new and I think they updated what is behind the doors on each floor. I don't recall it being digital / screen-based before, but rather a physical scene, although perhaps I'm misremembering as it has been a while. In any case the digital screens were very high definition and so surely have been at least updated. It was just as fun as I remembered, and they did a great job of fitting the Guardians of the Galaxy theme to the ride!

While in line I set up a Lightning Lane pass for the Cars Radiator Springs Racers ride so it'd be ready for me to hop on mid-morning. Disney's Lightning Lane system is set up so that you can only have one pass at a time, and the pass is for a future reservation time, like "come back at 11:45", and you can only reserve the next one when the previous one is **used**; this means in effect you get only 2 or 3 of these during the day, because you can't even try to get one for 12:00 until you actually *use* the one at 11:45... and so by the time you use the first pass all the reservations have already been filled for the day for all of the best rides. I suppose the strategy here is "How do we get people to pay for something that seems useful but isn't, so other guests aren't bothered by the fact that there's a pay-to-play option to get on the rides?" Disney is nothing if not efficiently capitalist: how do we take your money for the minimum actual value provided and/or hassle?

So, I had the pass for Radiator Springs Racers, and at the _very minute_ it was supposed to be available the ride had an issue and my pass got canceled. Which seems like a bummer, but... what Disney does in this situation is smart and actually worked in my favor. They refund you a voucher of a pass good for almost **any ride** at **any time**, and the voucher doesn't prevent you from getting more normal passes on the side. So you can effectively have two passes going at the same time, and this turned out to be absolutely perfect for the end of the day. I think they should give everyone who upgrades one non-time-restricted pass like this, personally.

While I was killing time before being able to use my not-yet-canceled pass I moved on to lunch, which I also had in The Avengers area. I got a sandwich and a pretzel from Pym Test Kitchen. This was a fun place to grab a 50 dollar lunch (or however much it cost) because they themed it on the Marvel movie "Ant Man", where the scifi-like power involved in the movie is things growing and shrinking in size sort of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"-style. So I got the (regular sized) sandwich. They also offered a giant pretzel, which I decided to get just for fun, because, I mean how big could it be? Turns out it was about the size of the lunch tray, maybe equivalent to four normal soft pretzels.

Um, maybe I can pretend I'm waiting for others to show up?

I took some away to nom over the course of the day, which turned out to be a pretty good strategy actually; any time I got the munchies in line I'd unwrap some of my messenger bag pretzel... you get all types in Disneyland, what can I say.

I had been messaging with Wolf thoughout the morning and managed to meet up with him and big Wolf and family after my lunch. We chatted a little bit and caught up on what's going on with our assorted lives while watching an Avengers themed theater thing; not a ride but a little area set aside in the park for actors to come and interact with the crowd. Wakandan warriors from Black Panther came out to teach the kids martial arts moves (was this a good idea?) and Big Wolf's kid Marcus was really into it, it was super cute. I volunteered to Marcus that my favorite Avenger is Iron Man and asked him who his favorite is: "All of them".

They were then going to go to a stage show inside of actual theater, where we wouldn't be able to chat, and I was more interested in riding rides, so we split up at that point. I think it would be really good to hang out with Wolf soon; it really brought home that over the course of the pandemic, everyone's gone their separate ways and we've lost touch a bit; it would be great to reconnect with all of the Purdue folks!

I continued my walk around California Adventure, past a Pixar Cars themed land based on Route 66, then past Boudin Bakery next to a Pier 39 recreation (minus the sea lions)... and started to wonder why I was there, as I lived near of these things and am about to embark on a tour of the Southwest portion of Route 66. I can experience the real thing in the course of a couple of weeks, seeing as I live in a California Adventure, so I decided it was time to hop parks to make sure I didn't miss out on anything in Disneyland proper!

That being said, these areas were fun, and I really liked what they did with the cars theme route 66 Halloween festivities; it felt seamless enough that it makes me wonder if they built it during a time that they were already doing Halloween events and designed in the possibility of Halloween-izing the area in this way. Things like pennants being replaced with orange cone teeth with muffler eyebrows and tire eyes, and jack-o-lantern road cones in the cone / teepee hotel area. There was a house at the end of the trail that acted as a singing haunted house, opening its eye-windows and door-mouth to serenade the audience.

I then moved on to Space Mountain, which is a classic and favorite of mine. One of the nice things about being a single rider at theme parks, especially when it's not super crowded, is you get put in situations that people wait a very long time to do like riding in the front car. I only wrote it once that day and I just got put in the front car straightaway, along with a woman who seemed to me to be riding Space Mountain for the first time. And as it turns out, it probably would have been a good idea for her to take off her Minnie Mouse ears. I'm not sure that she got to experience the ride as much more than holding on to her accoutrements, but she had a good sense of humor about it!

I had gotten ready to go back over to California Adventure when my ride got canceled, but now found myself without an agenda, so I pivoted over to Star Wars area of Disneyland which I'd never been to. It was really impressive. And you could see how delighted everybody was with the scene actors. You know, Kylo Ren walking out in amongst the kids and different aliens, all dressed up in costume wandering around. They really made it real for everybody. Which was a fun aspect that I think I saw more in the Star Wars Land than any other location in Disney. I wrote the motion simulator. Star Wars ride without any issues. And it was really, really cool. You could tell that they went all out on this ride, including a full scale Millennium Falcon at the entrance that everyone was taking pictures at. And Full Scale X Wing and transport ships

inside the ride itself. That made it seem very real based on the rate at which people were going into the ride,

and the little theatrical staging scene that they set up before you get on the ride proper. They must do something to move batches of people through that intermediate stage but I for the life of me I could not figure out the mechanism. I didn't feel any motion. And it wasn't obviously set into a wall or anything where they could just rotate the carousel and have more

people get on. So I was most curious about that part of the entire ride

and the ride itself was fun too. And those motion simulator rides often make me feel queasy. So it was good to know that this was not one of those occurrences. This is the end of Part One. I'm getting the meteor crater and I'll pick it up in part two in a second.
